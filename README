Welcome to Solidoodle! This is the Solidoodle firmware for the Solidoodle 2
3D Printer. It was originally developed by Eric Zalm. The firmware was modified
for the Solidoodle first by Sam Cervantes, then by Solidoodle user "Lawsy", and
most recently by Solidoodle employee Thomas Savino. Most of the changes to the
firmware are in the "configuration.h" file. The inner workings of the firmware
itself have not been changed substantially. 

Lawsy's Read me follows: 
#Marlin firmware for Solidoodle 2

Previous official Solidoodle firmware was based on early version of Marlin and could not be altered to accomodate a Panelolu LCD screen and encoder without many errors. This version has configuration.h and configuration_adv.h altered to reflect all changes found in official Solidoodle firmware.

#Step 1

You need to have the Arduino0022 IDE installed. If you have a later version, you'll need to downgrade.

PC Users: A version of Arduino022 already setup for this firmware is now available in the download section. Simply unzip into a folder of your choice.
Skip to step 4.

MAC Users: Download from:

-http://arduino.cc/hu/Main/Software


#Step 2  (Mac only)

Clone the repository at

-https://github.com/jmgiacalone/sanguino1284p

and copy the included Sanguino directory to the hardware directory of your Arduino install. On Mac OS X, that would be ~/Documents/Arduino/hardware.


#Step 3  (Mac Only)

Close the Arduino IDE and then copy the file avrdude.conf from the sanguino1284p clone to your ~/Documents/Arduino/hardware/tools/avr/etc.

Start the Arduino IDE and you should now see 'Sanguino W/ ATmega644P' AND 'Sanguino W/ ATmega1284P' options in the Tools->Board menu.


#Step 4

For the standard Solidoodle 2 model with the 644P microcontroller, upload the firmware as is and select the 'Sanguino W/ ATmega644P' option.


#Step 5

If you're adding an SDSL SDCARD reader, or Panelolu LCD display and rotary encoder with SDSL, you will need to select the 'Sanguino W/ ATmega1284P' board. Please purchase a 1284P with a bootloader already in place.

For a Panelolu/SD card reader combo, uncomment line 302 in configuration.h from:

```C
//#define ULTIPANEL
```
to:
```C
#define ULTIPANEL
```

Now compile and upload.

If you're only adding SDSL, uncomment line 290 in configuration.h from:

```C
//#define SDSUPPORT // Enable SD Card Support in Hardware Console
```
to:
```C
#define SDSUPPORT // Enable SD Card Support in Hardware Console
```

Now compile and upload.

Eric's original Read-Me follows below: 

A new beta version is avaiable.
Look under the Marlin_v1 branch. We also made a tag that you can download.

This firmware is a mashup between Sprinter, grbl and many original parts.
 (https://github.com/kliment/Sprinter)
 (https://github.com/simen/grbl/tree)

Features:
 - Interrupt based movement with real linear acceleration
 - High steprate
 - Look ahead (Keep the speed high when possible. High cornering speed)
 - Interrupt based temperature protection
 - preliminary support for Matthew Roberts advance algorithm 
   For more info see: http://reprap.org/pipermail/reprap-dev/2011-May/003323.html

This firmware is optimized for gen6 electronics.

The default baudrate is 250000. 
This gives less communication errors then regular baudrates.

Configuring and compilation


Install the arduino software version 0018
   http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Install the sanguino software, version 0018
   http://sanguino.cc/useit

Install pronterface
   https://github.com/kliment/Printrun

Copy the Marlin firmware
   https:/github.com/ErikZalm/Marlin
   (Use the download button)

Start the arduino IDE.
Select Tools -> Board -> Sanguino 
Select the correct serial port in Tools ->Serial Port
Open Marlin.pde

Change the printer specific setting in Configuration.h to the correct values.

The following values are the most important:
 - float axis_steps_per_unit[]....         // Set the correct steps / mm in the corresponding field
 - const bool ENDSTOPS_INVERTING = false;  // Change if only positive moves are executed
 - #define INVERT_x_DIR true               // Change if the motor direction is wrong

Click the Upload button
If all goes well the firmware is uploading

Start pronterface

Select the correct Serial Port. Type 250000 in the baudrate field.
Press the Connect button

===============================================================================================
Known issues

On some systems we get compilation errors.

This is caused by the "wiring_serial.c" and "wiring.c".
The simple fix is to delete these files but this may have a performance impact.

The best workaround is to move these files to sanguino directory. 
(".../arduino-0018/hardware/Sanguino/cores/arduino/" on windows systems)
